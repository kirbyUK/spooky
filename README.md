spooky
======

A curses rougelike game about trick-or-treating written in Perl. Wander around
the neighbourhood collecting candy, fighting opposing trick-or-treaters for
their candy, spending candy on equipment to boost stats to fight more
enemies to gathe more candy to...

This is my entry to the [Warwick Game Design](https://warwickgamedesign.co.uk)
two-week competition (with the theme 'Spooky'), but my current plan is to work
on it afterwards as well to add things like procedural generation.

## Installation

Requires Perl and currently the following modules:
```
Curses
```
